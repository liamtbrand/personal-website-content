Hi! I'm Liam. Welcome to my digital garden.

This website will mainly focus on software engineering and system administration.

There isn't much here yet. The plan is to bring over the content from the old website to the new website. This may take some time.

Maybe you're looking for [windows](https://windows.liamtbrand.com)?

I have written some [[How-to guides]] to test out how quartz renders notes and links from [[Obsidian]].

I also have a [[Projects]] page to showcase past projects.

To follow my website for updates, subscribe using [RSS](https://liamtbrand.com/index.xml).

If you want to cache this content locally, you can clone the git repo:
```shell
git clone git@github.com:liamtbrand/personal-website-content.git liams-notes
```

I have the repository symlinked into my Obsidian. You could do the same. Or you could clone `quartz` and symlink the content there to host the site locally.
