# Overview
The how-to guides on my website are intended to save you time. They attempt to get you up and running quickly and introduce you to useful tools and techniques to make your life easy.

These guides reflect how I use these tools. These guides are not the only way of doing things. They are also not intended to address topics or features in detail. Many tools mentioned have detailed documentation that you can read at the authoritative websites to find out more.

> Like the MIT license, use the guidance I provide at your own risk.
> If you spot something incorrect, please contact me so I can fix it.
