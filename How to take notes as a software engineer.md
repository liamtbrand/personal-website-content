As a Software Engineer you are a knowledge worker. As a knowledge worker, you are paid to know things. Knowing things requires learning them and remembering them.

Remembering things is hard.

We have many tools to remember things:
- Calendar for events we need to attent
- Todo lists to remind us of tasks
- Email inbox (although you really shouldn't use it this way)
